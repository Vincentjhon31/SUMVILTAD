## ❓ **If Notification STILL Doesn't Appear:**

Check these settings on your phone:

- Go to: **Settings** → **Apps** → **SumviltadConnect**
- Tap: **Notifications**
- Make sure: **Allow notifications** is ON ✅

### **2. Do Not Disturb**
- Swipe down from top
- Make sure **Do Not Disturb** is OFF

### **4. Restart Phone**
- Sometimes Google Play Services needs a refresh

- Try creating event again

## 🔧 **TEST #2: Rebuild App (For When App is Open)**

I added extensive logging to show notifications even when app is open.

### Steps:
1. In Android Studio: **Build** → **Rebuild Project**
2. Run the app
3. Keep the app **OPEN**
4. Watch **Logcat** (filter: `MyFirebaseMsgService`)
5. **Create event** from admin dashboard

### Expected Logcat Output:
```
D/MyFirebaseMsgService: ========================================
D/MyFirebaseMsgService: 📩 FCM MESSAGE RECEIVED!
D/MyFirebaseMsgService: From: 62836012915
D/MyFirebaseMsgService: 🔔 sendNotification called
D/MyFirebaseMsgService: ✅ Notification displayed!
D/MyFirebaseMsgService: ========================================
```

### Expected Result:
**📱 Notification appears even with app open!**

## 📊 **What Your Backend Shows:**

```
[SUCCESS] Notification sent to Firebase
[SUCCESS] Firebase accepted (status 200)
[SUCCESS] Message ID: 0:1761550503940338%b893d2bdb893d2bd
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Your backend code is correct
- ✅ Firebase received the notification
- ✅ Firebase will deliver to your device

**If notification doesn't appear, it's a device/app issue, not backend!**

---

## 🎯 **Most Common Issues:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Notification permission denied** | Go to Settings → Apps → Enable notifications |
| **Do Not Disturb mode** | Turn it off |
| **Battery optimization** | Disable for SumviltadConnect |
| **App is open** | Close the app or rebuild with new logging |
| **Google Play Services outdated** | Update from Play Store |
| **Phone manufacturer blocking** | Some Xiaomi/Huawei phones block notifications - check manufacturer settings |

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS = Notification Appears!**

When you see the notification on your phone showing:
```
📱 New Event: [Your Event Title]
   A new event has been scheduled for October 28, 2025
```

**THEN EVERYTHING IS WORKING! 🎉**

---

## 🆘 **Still Not Working?**

**Try this debug test:**

1. Close SumviltadConnect app
2. Open **Google Messages** or **Gmail** app (to confirm notifications work)
3. Send yourself a test email or SMS
4. **Does notification appear?**
   - **YES** → Your device notifications work, issue is with SumviltadConnect settings
   - **NO** → Your device has notification issues (check Do Not Disturb, etc.)

---

**DO TEST #1 NOW (close app and create event)!** That's the easiest test and should work immediately! 🚀
