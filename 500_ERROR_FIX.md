# 🔧 500 Error Fixed - json_decode() Type Error

## ❌ Error Found

```
HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
json_decode(): Argument #1 ($json) must be of type string, array given
Line: 676 in CropHealthController.php
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `$cropHealth->predictions` field was **already an array**, not a JSON string, so calling `json_decode()` on it caused a type error.

This happened because Laravel automatically casts the `predictions` column to an array if it's defined in the model's `$casts` property.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Changed the code to check if `predictions` is already an array before trying to decode it:

### Before (Broken):
```php
$rawPredictions = json_decode($cropHealth->predictions, true);  // ❌ Error if already array
```

### After (Fixed):
```php
// Check if predictions is already an array or needs to be decoded
if (is_array($cropHealth->predictions)) {
    $rawPredictions = $cropHealth->predictions;  // ✅ Use as-is
} else {
    $rawPredictions = json_decode($cropHealth->predictions, true);  // ✅ Decode if string
}
```
