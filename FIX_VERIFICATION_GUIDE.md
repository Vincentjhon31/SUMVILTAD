# Fix Applied: 502 Error Now Triggers Offline Fallback

## What Was Fixed

The `handleHttpError()` function in `DiseaseDetectionService.kt` was updated to properly handle different HTTP error codes:

### ✅ Fixed Code
```kotlin
private fun handleHttpError(e: retrofit2.HttpException): DiseaseDetectionResponse {
    return when (e.code()) {
        400 -> {
            // Only 400 errors mean "not a rice leaf"
            DiseaseDetectionResponse(
                is_rice_leaf = false,
                message = "Image is not recognized as a rice leaf",
                ...
            )
        }
        502, 503, 504 -> {
            // Server errors now THROW to trigger offline fallback
            throw Exception("Server is temporarily unavailable (${e.code()}). Falling back to offline detection.")
        }
        else -> {
            // All other errors also throw to trigger fallback
            throw Exception("Server error ${e.code()}: ${e.message()}")
        }
    }
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When you upload a rice leaf image and the server returns a 502 error:

### Before Fix ❌
```
1. Upload image → API returns 502 error
2. App shows: "Not a Rice Leaf"
3. User is confused (image IS a rice leaf!)
```

### After Fix ✅
```
1. Upload image → API returns 502 error
2. handleHttpError() throws exception for 502
3. Exception is caught in detectDisease()
4. App automatically falls back to offline ML model
5. Offline model analyzes the image
6. User sees: "Server temporarily unavailable. Using offline analysis."
7. User sees disease detection results from offline model
```

## What You Should See in LogCat

### New Log Messages
```
D/DiseaseDetection: Detection method: Online
W/DiseaseDetection: HTTP error 502: API returned HTML instead of JSON
W/DiseaseDetection: Server error detected, falling back to offline: Server is temporarily unavailable (502). Falling back to offline detection.
D/DiseaseDetection: Using offline ML model
```

### What Changed
- **Before**: Logs stopped at "HTTP error 502" and returned "not rice leaf"
- **After**: Logs continue with "falling back to offline" and "Using offline ML model"

## Testing Steps

1. **Build and install the updated app:**
   ```
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

2. **Try uploading a rice leaf image**

3. **Check LogCat for these messages:**
   - ✅ "HTTP error 502"
   - ✅ "Server error detected, falling back to offline"
   - ✅ "Using offline ML model"

4. **Verify the UI shows:**
   - ✅ Blue info card: "Server temporarily unavailable. Using offline analysis."
   - ✅ Detection results from offline model (not "not a rice leaf")

## What if the Offline Model Doesn't Work?

If you still see issues after this fix, it could mean:

1. **Offline model not loaded properly** - Check if `OfflineRiceDiseaseDetector` is working
2. **Offline model needs the rice leaf image format** - The offline model might have different requirements

To debug offline model issues, check for these logs:
```
D/DiseaseDetection: Using offline ML model
E/DiseaseDetection: Offline detection failed: [error message]
```

## Server-Side Fix (Recommended)

While the app now gracefully handles 502 errors, you should still fix the server issue:

1. **Check PHP timeout settings:**
   ```php
   ini_set('max_execution_time', 300); // 5 minutes
   ```

2. **Check web server timeout:**
   - Nginx: `proxy_read_timeout 300;`
   - Apache: `Timeout 300`

3. **Check if ML model is too slow:**
   - Consider caching results
   - Optimize model inference
   - Use async processing

## Summary

✅ **502 errors now trigger offline fallback**  
✅ **Users get detection results even when server is down**  
✅ **Clear messaging about offline mode**  
✅ **Only legitimate "not rice leaf" rejections (400 errors) show error message**

The fix is complete and ready for testing!
