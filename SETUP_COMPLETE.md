1. **Create Firebase Service Account**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create service account with **Firebase App Distribution Admin** role
   - Download JSON key file

2. **Get Firebase App ID**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Open Project Settings → Your apps

3. **Add GitHub Secrets**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Vincentjhon31/SUMVILTAD/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add these secrets:
     - `FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Your Firebase App ID
     - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Content of JSON key file
     - `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`: Content of app/google-services.json

### Step 2: Add Testers

1. Go to Firebase Console → App Distribution → Testers & Groups
2. Add tester email addresses
3. Create a group called "testers"
4. Add testers to the group

### Step 3: Test the Workflow

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd "c:\Users\jhon vincent\AndroidStudioProjects\SumviltadConnect"

# Create a test release tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0 - Initial release"

# Push the tag to trigger workflow
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Step 4: Monitor the Build

1. Go to: https://github.com/Vincentjhon31/SUMVILTAD/actions
2. Watch the workflow run
3. Wait for completion (5-10 minutes)
4. Check Firebase Console for the uploaded APK
