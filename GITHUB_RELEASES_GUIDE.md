# GitHub Releases - APK Distribution Guide

This guide explains how to distribute your APK to Sumviltad farmers using GitHub Releases (100% FREE!)

1. ✅ Build the APK automatically
2. ✅ Upload to Firebase App Distribution (for your team testing)
3. ✅ **Create GitHub Release with downloadable APK** (for farmers!)
4. ✅ Generate professional release notes

## 🔄 Releasing New Versions

### For Bug Fixes (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)
```powershell
# Update version in app/build.gradle.kts first:
# versionCode = 2
# versionName = "1.0.1"

git add app/build.gradle.kts
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.1"
git push origin main

# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed camera crash on Android 13

- Improved offline mode stability"

git push origin v1.0.1
```

### For New Features (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)
```powershell

# versionCode = 3
# versionName = "1.1.0"

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Announce Updates
When releasing new version, announce on:
- Your website
- Facebook page
- SMS to registered farmers
- Community meetings

### 2. Version Naming
Follow Semantic Versioning:
- **v1.0.0** → **v1.0.1**: Bug fixes only
- **v1.0.0** → **v1.1.0**: New features (backwards compatible)
- **v1.0.0** → **v2.0.0**: Major changes (breaking changes)

### 3. Release Notes
Always include:
- ✅ What's new
- ✅ Bug fixes
- ✅ Known issues (if any)
- ✅ Installation instructions

### 4. Test Before Release
1. Create tag locally first: `git tag -a v1.0.1-beta -m "Beta test"`
2. Push: `git push origin v1.0.1-beta`
3. Test with your team
4. If OK, create final: `git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release"`

## 📊 Tracking Downloads

GitHub doesn't provide download statistics by default, but you can:

### Option 1: Use GitHub API
Check release download count:
```
https://api.github.com/repos/Vincentjhon31/SUMVILTAD/releases/latest
```

Look for `download_count` in the response.

### Option 2: Add Analytics to Website
Use Google Analytics on your website download page to track clicks.

### Option 3: Use URL Shortener
Create a short link with analytics:
- bit.ly
- tinyurl.com
- Firebase Dynamic Links (free)

## 🆚 Comparison: GitHub vs Firebase

| Feature | GitHub Releases | Firebase Distribution |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Cost** | ✅ FREE | ✅ FREE |
| **File Size** | ✅ No limit | ✅ No limit |
| **Public Access** | ✅ Anyone can download | ❌ Email invite only |
| **Best For** | ✅ **Farmers** | ✅ **Your team testing** |
| **Installation** | Simple download | Requires Firebase App Tester |
| **Updates** | Manual (farmers check) | Automatic notifications |

**Solution**: Use BOTH! ✨
- **Firebase**: For your team and beta testers (5-20 people)
- **GitHub Releases**: For all farmers (hundreds/thousands)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "App Not Installed"
**Cause**: Conflicting app signature
**Solution**: Uninstall old version first, then install new one

### "Installation Blocked"
**Cause**: Unknown sources not enabled
**Solution**: Go to Settings → Security → Enable "Install unknown apps"

### Download is Slow
**Cause**: Large file (205MB)
**Solution**: Use WiFi instead of mobile data
