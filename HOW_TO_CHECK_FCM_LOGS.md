# 🔍 DETAILED LOGGING ADDED - How to Check What's Happening

## ✅ What I Just Did:

I added **EXTENSIVE LOGGING** to track exactly what happens when you create events or irrigation schedules.

### Files Updated:
1. ✅ **EventController.php** - Added detailed FCM logging
2. ✅ **IrrigationScheduleController.php** - Added detailed FCM logging  
3. ✅ **FirebaseNotificationService.php** - Added step-by-step logging

---

## 🚀 UPLOAD THESE FILES TO HOSTINGER NOW:

Upload these 3 files to your Hostinger:

```
app/Http/Controllers/EventController.php
app/Http/Controllers/IrrigationScheduleController.php
app/Services/FirebaseNotificationService.php
```

**Then clear cache:**
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

---

## 📊 HOW TO CHECK LOGS:

### **Method 1: Real-time Log Monitoring (Recommended)**

On Hostinger SSH, run this BEFORE creating an event:

```bash
cd public_html
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

**Keep this running!** Then in another browser tab:

1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Create a new event
3. **Watch the terminal** - you'll see EVERYTHING happening in real-time!

### **Method 2: Check Logs After Creating Event**

```bash
cd public_html
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## 🔍 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

### **Issue 1: "Service account exists: NO"**

**Problem:** Service account JSON file not uploaded to Hostinger

**Solution:**
```bash
# On Hostinger, check:
ls -la storage/app/svtc-acd06-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-f704250edf.json

# If missing, upload it from your local machine
```

### **Issue 2: "Found 0 farmers with FCM tokens"**

**Problem:** No farmers have logged into the mobile app yet

**Solution:**
1. Open mobile app
2. Login with farmer account
3. Check Logcat for: "✅ FCM token sent to server successfully"
4. Run: `php check-fcm-tokens.php`
5. Try creating event again

### **Issue 3: "Response status: 401" or "403"**

**Problem:** Firebase API not enabled or invalid credentials

**Solution:**
- Verify service account JSON file is correct
- Check Firebase Console: Cloud Messaging API is enabled
- Re-download service account if needed

### **Issue 4: "Response status: 404"**

**Problem:** Invalid FCM token (token expired or app reinstalled)

**Solution:**
- User needs to logout and login again
- This will register a fresh FCM token

## 📋 QUICK CHECKLIST:

Before creating event, verify:

- [ ] ✅ Upload updated controller files to Hostinger
- [ ] ✅ Run `php artisan config:clear` on Hostinger
- [ ] ✅ Service account JSON file exists on Hostinger
- [ ] ✅ At least 1 farmer has FCM token (run `php check-fcm-tokens.php`)
- [ ] ✅ Start log monitoring: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
- [ ] ✅ Create test event
- [ ] ✅ Watch logs for success/error messages
- [ ] ✅ Check mobile device for notification

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT COMMANDS:

### **Check Current Logs:**
```bash
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "FCM"
```

### **Check FCM Tokens in Database:**
```bash
php check-fcm-tokens.php
```

### **Test Manual Notification:**
```bash
php test-send-notification.php
```

### **Clear All Logs (Start Fresh):**
```bash
echo "" > storage/logs/laravel.log
```

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW:

1. **Upload the 3 updated files** to Hostinger
2. **Clear cache**: `php artisan config:clear`
3. **Start log monitoring**: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. **Create a test event**
5. **Read the logs** - they will tell you EXACTLY what's happening!

---

The logs will show you:
- ✅ If FCM code is being called
- ✅ If farmers have tokens
- ✅ If service account file exists
- ✅ If access token is obtained
- ✅ If notification is sent to Firebase
- ✅ Response from Firebase (success or error)
