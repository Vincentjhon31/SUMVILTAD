# Complete Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Push Notifications Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Your test notifications are working! Now let's make sure push notifications work for real events and irrigation schedules.

---

## üìã What I've Implemented

### Backend (Laravel/PHP)
1. ‚úÖ Database migration for `fcm_token` field in users table
2. ‚úÖ Updated User model to include `fcm_token` in fillable fields
3. ‚úÖ Complete `FirebaseNotificationService` implementation
4. ‚úÖ Integrated FCM notifications in `EventController` (when events are created/updated)
5. ‚úÖ Integrated FCM notifications in `IrrigationScheduleController` (when schedules are created/updated)
6. ‚úÖ API endpoint `/api/notifications/fcm-token` already exists

### Android App
1. ‚úÖ Firebase Messaging Service (`MyFirebaseMessagingService`) already working
2. ‚úÖ Updated MainActivity to send FCM token to backend after login
3. ‚úÖ Updated MyFirebaseMessagingService to send token when refreshed
4. ‚úÖ Updated ApiService to support FCM token storage

---

## üöÄ Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Open your terminal and navigate to your Laravel project:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\jhon vincent\AndroidStudioProjects\SumviltadConnect\app\sampledata"
php artisan migrate
```

This will add the `fcm_token` column to your users table.

---

### Step 2: Get Firebase Server Key

1. Go to **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: **SumviltadConnect**
3. Click the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** icon (gear icon) ‚Üí **Project settings**
4. Go to the **Cloud Messaging** tab
5. Scroll down to **Cloud Messaging API (Legacy)**
6. Find **Server key** and copy it

**IMPORTANT:** If you see a message saying "Cloud Messaging API (Legacy) is disabled", you need to enable it:
   - Click the **‚ãÆ** (three dots) menu
   - Click **Manage API in Google Cloud Console**
   - This will open Google Cloud Console
   - Click **ENABLE** for "Firebase Cloud Messaging API"
   - Wait a few seconds, then go back to Firebase Console and refresh
   - You should now see the Server Key

---

### Step 3: Add Firebase Server Key to Laravel .env

1. Open your `.env` file located at:
   ```
   C:\Users\jhon vincent\AndroidStudioProjects\SumviltadConnect\app\sampledata\.env
   ```

2. Add this line at the end (replace with your actual server key):
   ```env
   FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY_HERE
   ```

3. Save the file

4. Clear Laravel config cache:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\jhon vincent\AndroidStudioProjects\SumviltadConnect\app\sampledata"
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   ```

---

### Step 4: Rebuild Android App

Since we modified the code, you need to rebuild the app:

1. In Android Studio, click **Build** ‚Üí **Clean Project**
2. Then click **Build** ‚Üí **Rebuild Project**
3. Run the app on your device

---

### Step 5: Test the Integration

#### Test 1: Login and Check Token Storage

1. **Open the app and login** with a farmer account
2. Check Android Logcat for these messages:
   ```
   FCM Token: [your-token-here]
   FCM token sent to server successfully
   ```

3. **Verify in database** that the token is stored:
   - Open your database (phpMyAdmin or MySQL)
   - Check the `users` table
   - Find your user and verify `fcm_token` column has a value

#### Test 2: Create an Event (Admin Dashboard)

1. **Login to your admin web dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Events** page
3. **Create a new event** with these details:
   - Title: "Test Push Notification Event"
   - Description: "Testing FCM notifications"
   - Event Date: Tomorrow
   - Location: Any location
   - Status: Upcoming

4. **Check your mobile app** - you should receive a push notification!

5. **Check Laravel logs** for confirmation:
   ```
   C:\Users\jhon vincent\AndroidStudioProjects\SumviltadConnect\app\sampledata\storage\logs\laravel.log
   ```
   Look for: `FCM notification sent successfully`

#### Test 3: Create Irrigation Schedule (Admin Dashboard)

1. **Login to admin dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Irrigation Schedules**
3. **Create a new schedule** or update existing one
4. **Check your mobile app** - you should receive a push notification!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Firebase Server Key not configured"

**Solution:** Make sure you added `FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY` to your `.env` file and ran `php artisan config:clear`

### Issue 2: No push notifications received

**Checks:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify FCM token is stored in database (users.fcm_token column)
2. ‚úÖ Check Android Logcat for any errors
3. ‚úÖ Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. ‚úÖ Make sure your device is connected to internet
5. ‚úÖ Verify Firebase Server Key is correct

### Issue 3: "Failed to send FCM token: 401"

**Solution:** This means the user is not authenticated. Make sure:
- User is logged in
- Auth token is stored in SharedPreferences
- API endpoint requires authentication

### Issue 4: Notifications work in test but not from admin

**Solution:**
1. Check if FirebaseNotificationService is being called
2. Add logging in EventController/IrrigationScheduleController
3. Verify farmers have `fcm_token` in database

---

## üì± How the System Works Now

### When User Opens App:
1. App requests notification permission (Android 13+)
2. Firebase generates FCM token
3. App sends token to backend API: `POST /api/notifications/fcm-token`
4. Backend stores token in `users.fcm_token` column

### When Admin Creates Event:
1. Admin creates event in web dashboard
2. Backend creates database notification records
3. Backend sends email notifications
4. Backend sends SMS notifications (if enabled)
5. **Backend sends FCM push notifications** to all farmers with tokens
6. Farmers receive push notification on their devices

### When Admin Creates/Updates Irrigation Schedule:
1. Admin creates/updates irrigation schedule
2. Backend creates database notification records
3. **Backend sends FCM push notifications** to all farmers with tokens
4. Farmers receive push notification on their devices

---

## üéØ What Happens When Farmer Taps Notification

Currently, tapping the notification opens the MainActivity. You can customize this behavior later by:
- Adding deep links to specific screens
- Handling notification data in `onMessageReceived`
- Opening specific event/irrigation details
