# 🔍 FCM Token Not Storing - Diagnosis & Fix

## ❌ Problem Found:

Your Android app is trying to send FCM token to backend **BEFORE user logs in**, so it fails silently because there's no auth token.

### Current Flow (BROKEN):
```
App starts
    ↓
getFCMToken() called immediately  ❌ NO AUTH TOKEN YET
    ↓
sendTokenToServer() fails silently
    ↓
User logs in later
    ↓
Token still not sent ❌
```

---

## ✅ Solution:

We need to send the FCM token **AFTER** the user successfully logs in AND when the token is refreshed.

### Correct Flow:
```
User logs in
    ↓
Auth token saved
    ↓
getFCMToken() called
    ↓
sendTokenToServer() with valid auth token ✅
    ↓
Token stored in database
```

## 🔧 Files That Need Fixing:

1. **MainActivity.kt** - Don't send token immediately on app start
2. **AuthViewModel.kt** - Send FCM token after successful login
3. **MyFirebaseMessagingService.kt** - Send token when it's refreshed

---

## 📝 Testing the Current Issue:

On Hostinger, create this test file to check tokens:

```php
<?php
// check-fcm-tokens.php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();

// Connect to database
$conn = new mysqli(
    env('DB_HOST'),
    env('DB_USERNAME'),
    env('DB_PASSWORD'),
    env('DB_DATABASE')
);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

echo "========================================\n";
echo "FCM Token Status Check\n";
echo "========================================\n\n";

// Check all users
$result = $conn->query("SELECT id, name, email, role, fcm_token FROM users");

echo "Total users: " . $result->num_rows . "\n\n";

$withToken = 0;
$withoutToken = 0;

while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    $hasToken = !empty($row['fcm_token']);
    
    if ($hasToken) {
        $withToken++;
        $tokenPreview = substr($row['fcm_token'], 0, 30) . '...';
        echo "✅ {$row['name']} ({$row['role']}): HAS TOKEN\n";
        echo "   Preview: {$tokenPreview}\n\n";
    } else {
        $withoutToken++;
        echo "❌ {$row['name']} ({$row['role']}): NO TOKEN\n\n";
    }
}

echo "========================================\n";
echo "Summary:\n";
echo "✅ Users WITH FCM token: {$withToken}\n";
echo "❌ Users WITHOUT FCM token: {$withoutToken}\n";
echo "========================================\n";

$conn->close();
?>
```

Run it on Hostinger:
```bash
php check-fcm-tokens.php
```

This will show you which users have tokens and which don't.

## 🚀 Quick Test on Mobile:

To test if the token is being sent correctly:

1. **Open Android Studio Logcat**
2. **Clear filters**
3. **Run the app**
4. **Login with a farmer account**
5. **Look for these logs:**

```
D/MainActivity: FCM Token: [long-token-here]
D/MainActivity: FCM token sent to server successfully  ← Should see this
```

If you see:
```
W/MainActivity: User not logged in, FCM token not sent to server
```

This confirms the problem - token is being sent before login!

## 💡 Immediate Workaround (For Testing):

While I prepare the fix, you can manually test by:

1. **Login to your app first**
2. **Close the app completely** (swipe away from recent apps)
3. **Open the app again**
4. The token should now be sent because you're logged in

Check database again after this:
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, fcm_token FROM users WHERE email='your-farmer-email@example.com';
```

The fcm_token column should now have a value.
